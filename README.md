## About Me
Hi! I'm Trieu, a civil engineer turned software engineer. As a civil engineer, I enjoy solving problems in the most unorthodox way and creating projects that the general public uses everyday. During my time in project management, I became very passionate about technology more specifically, artificial intelligence in construction. And on May 2021, I made a decision to study software engineering from a coding bootcamp - General Assembly - in hope to make a bigger impact on society.

I enjoy working with React and JavaScript!

## Deployed Projects
- [Speech Audit](https://speechaudit.netlify.app/): Has there ever been a situation where you were unsure how a sentence or paragraph is perceived by others? With the help of this app, Speech Audit, and IBM's Speech to Text and Tone Analyzer API, users are able to see what emotion others may perceive in your sentence!
- [devOgraphy](https://devography.netlify.app/): A working, an interactive, full-stack application that receives data from a custom API that my team designed. The app allows users to learn more about programming languages, their icons, their authors, and their creation date.
- [Cook Assistant](https://cook-assistant.netlify.app/): Aworking, interactive, React application that recieved data from Edamam, the third-party API. The app allows users to find a recipe that fits their dietary needs and search for any key ingredient that the user wants in the recipe.
- [Frantic Engineer](https://trieule50.github.io/frantic-engineer-project1/): Inspired by Snake and my previous career, Frantic Engineer is about an engineer who is getting ready to bid on a project. However, in order to submit the bid on time, all the proposal sheets will need to be collected.









<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
